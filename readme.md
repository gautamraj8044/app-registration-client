### Simple Steps to Run the Code

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Open your terminal and install the required package (`requirements.txt`) by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the Flask Server Database Managment:**
   Run your Flask app (`run.py`) to start the server. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where `run.py` is saved and run:

   python run.py
   ```
   This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Run the Python Script:**
   Save the Python script (`main.py`) and run it by navigating to the folder where the script is saved and running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Check the Output:**
   If successful, you should see a message like:
   ```bash
   Data sent successfully!
   Server Response:
   {
       "message": "App added successfully",
       "id": 1
   }
   ```
